The smell of moss and herbs fill your senses, and the sound of dried leaves crunch beneath your feet. It's hypnotic...comforting, and perhaps even a bit intoxicating. You hear the crows in the distance. They seem to beckon you to go just a little bit deeper into the forest. Just then, you notice the path behind you, seems to have vanished into the mist. You see the faint light in the distance, and walk towards it. You come upon a small rustic cabin, covered with ivy. The door is cracked open...just a pinch...and you're chilled from the damp night air, so you enter inside. \nA fire is burning in an old stone fireplace, and a small kettle of warm soup hangs from an iron hook, before it. On the table by the window, you notice cards laid out, beside a cup of strong herbal tea, and a loaf of freshly baked bread.\nYou hear a voice say \"come in for a spell! sit! sit!...have some bread and tea.\";  The tone of her voice seems mischievous, yet you're chilled to the bone, so decide it best to sit and warm yourself. You break off some bread, sip on the tea, and begin to look through the curious, yet... hauntingly familiar cards, laid out before you, on the tattered cloth.*~\n     \nEach card signifies an aspect of the Autumn season, with hints of folk majik and carnivalia. From pumpkins to creepy dolls; skulls and skeletons to plants and other bewitching details.\nAll are numbered by count of stars - 1 through 20-, and are marked with the Aki-Aki kanji in lower right corner. \n\n~Lovingly handcrafted for the Gothic Bohemian, Dark Mori, and other kindred souls and wandering spirits, who find solace and delight in the shadowy forest. <3 \n\n", "edition_size": "limited", "difficulty": "Easy"}, {"id": 8254, "name": "Tinos", "name_slug": "tinos", "creator": {"username": "toxirat", "name": "Tox Box"}, "description": "Want a Tiny Dino?

The locomotive would thunder past, crushing the little pieces of bronze into oddly shaped, paper-thin abstracts, somehow made magical by the simple act of transformation. Trains were like that for me, unchained freedom racing headlong down a track into who knows where. Although the path of a speeding train is always predetermined by two outstretched metal ribbons running between points on a map, I always wondered about the tunnels. I mean think about it.

(Hopefully)\n_______________________________\nQ&A:\n\n- Why expansions?\n\nFor what I have planned, there is a lot, and I mean a LOT of cards being planned for the future. For me, I thought this may be a little bit easier since I'm still learning how to create digital art, and it'll give me time to live my own life as well... so, it is going to be a long road.\n\n- Why did you decide a \"pro\" card pack over an amateur?\n\nIn all honesty, I look at the \"pro\" packs as a tip jar. You don't HAVE to buy if you don't want to, it's just there if you want to be supportive, but even that, just sending a \"Hello! Keep up the good work!\" is worth more than you'd think.\n\n- Can I help or link things to you to help you become better at drawing?\n\nABSOLUTELY! Just, please, don't share with me speed paintings. I know they're good and all for inspiration, but a lot of the times they don't exactly tell me \"how\" they made it the way they did (i.e method of tools or tricks).\n\n- I noticed the character \"Jazael\" doesn't have a gif----\n\n\"Shhhh.... it's a secret.\"\nNah, There are just certain cards I'm saving as individual expansion cards for another expansion series.\n\n- What expansions do you have planned exactly?\n\n- Hell & Fire\n- Death & Necro\n- Water & Ice\n- Earth & Steel\n- Arcane & Void\n- Wind & Wings\n- etc...\n\n- Is the Starter Pack relevant to the others, like are the characters in that pack actual characters for the overall series?\n\nThe answer is yes, but at the same time, it was also a pack to test the waters. More than likely, I will be making remakes of them for their according expansions (at least making them look better.) \n_______________________________\nMy own personal questions to you guys:\n\n- Do you want me to flesh out the lore of Arcalon Knights, or just leave as is?\n\n- Would actual character portraits like \"Young Yulai\" be more welcomed?\n- Are the \"Making of\" gifs something you guys like?", "edition_size": "limited", "difficulty": "Very Easy"}, {"id": 8515, "name": "Mouthy", "name_slug": "mouthy", "creator": {"username": "buttheck", "name": "Kim Cassin"}, "description": "Everyone likes a luscious lip or two ... well I do at least.

Tried to make the more popular cards lower rarity.  It is recommended that you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS below prior to trading, to ensure you don't accidentally trade something you don't want to.\n\nThese cards are meant to be used as Trading Tools.  Use these cards when proposing trades to help let the other person know what you want and what you are willing to trade.  By the end of the trade, these Trade Tool cards should not be in the list of items to trade (so that you can re-use them in future trades).\n\nNote that the PURPLE banner cards are riskier to use, which are to be used as a Reaction to a trade rather than to initiate a trade.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR NON PURPLE CARDS:\n1) Seek card(s) you want, add to trade window\n2) Instead of offering a specific card, give a green/orange banner card to let the other person know that they should choose what they want (and to let them know what kinds of cards you will trade [orange banner])\n3) Other person should see and Counter your trade, and replace the Trade Tool card with cards they actually want from you\n4) Choose if you want to Accept or Counter the trade (the trade tool should no longer be part of the trade)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR PURPLE CARDS:\n1) Someone proposes a trade to you, but you don't like what they are giving you\n2) To passively request a different trade, can Counter the trade and offer the Purple cards which states your preferences on it.  \n\nTo do this, it is recommended that you first Add some other random high rarity cards onto the other person's trade window of what they will give to you.  This is done to protect you from having them Accept the trade you don't want prematurely, when you Counter it.\n\n3) Again, ensure that everything looks good (the rarities on the other person's side is greater than what you are offering currently), and that there's a low chance of getting a trade you don't want if they decide to Accept before replacing the cards.  Send the Countered Trade.\n4) They will see the unbalanced rarities, and the instructions to \"Send me a different offer\" with your preferences.  They can either choose to Decline or give you a different trade with what you want.\n5) NOTE: If any of this does not make sense or you are uncomfortable, feel free to ignore/ trade away the PURPLE banner cards.", "edition_size": "unlimited", "difficulty": "Moderate"}, {"id": 11737, "name": "Steampunk Arsenal - Handguns", "name_slug": "steampunk-arsenal-handguns", "creator": {"username": "laurentiu.danila", "name": "Laurentiu Neagu"}, "description": "A series of peculiar handguns from an imaginary steampunk world.

These high-contrast, achromatic portraits focus on the many faces of wildlife and remove the creatures from any context. Stripped of their colorful hues, the animals remain in shades of black and white, bare and raw before the viewer. Their values, textures, and patterns strongly contrast against the deep black of the background as the stark, white outlines highlight their various forms and shapes. Exposed in the spotlight, each animal bares an almost stoic, echoing expression that fills the void with its personality and spirit. Each quaint portrait boldly embodies the presence of the species it portrays and delicately reveals the vulnerabilities of each individual animal.\n\nCollecting this trading card series is meant to represent the fleeting sense of the wildlife left in this world as each card is as rare as the animal it depicts. While the most common cards represent species classified as \u201cLeast Concern\u201d on the [International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species](https://www.iucnredlist.org), \u201cEndangered\u201d and \u201cCritically Endangered\u201d creatures are reserved for more scarce pulls. Because collectors will constantly pull common species, the discovery of an endangered species is made more fulfilling and interesting, thus bringing more attention to these portraits. The rarest of cards depict beasts of myths and legends, such as dragons and unicorns, a real treat for dedicated collectors.\n_____\n\nLike this series?

These achromatic portraits focus on the faces of wildlife and remove the creatures from context. Stripped of their hues, the animals remain bare and raw before the viewer. Their values, textures, and patterns contrast against the deep black of the background as the stark, white outlines highlight their various forms and shapes. Each portrait boldly embodies the presence of the species it portrays and delicately reveals the vulnerabilities of each individual animal.\n\nCollecting this trading card series is meant to represent the fleeting sense of the wildlife left in this world as each card is as rare as the animal it depicts. While the most common cards represent species classified as \u201cLeast Concern\u201d on the [International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species](https://www.iucnredlist.org/), \u201cEndangered\u201d and \u201cCritically Endangered\u201d creatures are reserved for more scarce pulls. Because collectors will constantly pull common species, the discovery of an endangered species is made more fulfilling and interesting, thus bringing more attention to these portraits.

Unlike his more famous contemporaries, Claude Monet and John Singer Sargent, who achieved success with highly esoteric modes of painting, Thayer spent his entire career experimenting according to his own artistic beliefs and interests. At once he was an Impressionist and a Realist, a Symbolist and a Romanticist, not to mention a loving father and a passionate naturalist. Although primarily remembered as a Realist painter, even his Realism contains elements of Symbolism and Medievalism, styles especially apparent throughout his famous angel series, wherein archaic Christian deities are painted according to modern techniques. A lover of nature who managed to infuriate Theodore Roosevelt with his (incorrect) hypothesis that all animal coloration is meant to serve as camouflage, Thayer was nevertheless a proactive conservationist who managed to save New Hampshire\u2019s beautiful Monadnock wilderness from development, and even now the area remains untouched.
